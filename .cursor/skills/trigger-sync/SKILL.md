# Trigger Upstream Sync

## Usage

Run the sync workflow for the CLI mirror repo:

```bash
gh workflow run sync-upstream.yml --ref sync-upstream -R redhat-openshift-builds/shipwright-io-cli
```

## Check status

After triggering, check the run status:

```bash
gh run list --workflow=sync-upstream.yml -R redhat-openshift-builds/shipwright-io-cli --limit 1
```

If a run failed, view the logs:

```bash
gh run view <RUN_ID> --log-failed -R redhat-openshift-builds/shipwright-io-cli
```
